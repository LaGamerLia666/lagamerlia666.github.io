      <h3>The day has come >:D</h3>
      <p>In my previous post I bragged that I was getting a new phone, and now I'll brag <i>and</i> whine about that phone!<br>
      So I got the phone last Wednesday 30th, I immediately opened the <a href="https://doc.e.foundation/devices/Mi439/install" target="_blank">guide</a> for my exact model. Then I found a small problem when trying to follow step 6 for unlocking the bootloader: I don't use window&dollar;<br>
      No problem, my dad uses window&dollar; on his laptop, I'll just borrow it for a moment. He said yes, so I downloaded the unlocking program on his laptop and did what it asked me. I created an account and... It wants me to wait 168 hours to "verify &lsqb;my&rsqb; account." For the uninitiated, that's 7 days!<br>
      Just, fuck you Xiaomi, I hate you.<br>
      That was almost 168 hours ago so tonight I'll borrow my dad's laptop again to use it and join the /e/cosystem.<br>
      One thing that concerns me though, a step on the guide tells me to flash an image that didn't come with the provided files. I'll ask in the community forums about that.<br>
      Maybe I can use one from LineageOS? Since /e/ is a fork of it, maybe they're compatible.<br><br>
      I'm hopeful about this, good night.</p>
