      <h3>FUCKING CHESS AND ✨TRANS PEOPLE✨</h3>
      <p>The FIDE has released <a href="https://doc.fide.com/docs/DOC/2FC2023/CM2_2023_45.pdf">a document</a> stating that trans women cannot compete against cis women because the organization suspects a "biological advantage" and they're using that piece of shit while they come to a conclusion on that (THEY DO NOT).<br>
        The only "advantage" I can possibly think of is that when a trans person loses and suffers gamer rage, they can throw the checkerboard farther away than a cis woman. Even so, that is still not a valid argument due to biological advantage, again, not existing.<br>
        On an equally shitty note: trans men will have their pre-transitioning titles wiped or their level reduced. But fear not! They can recover their titles if- *checks notes* they DETRANSITION!? What were the people who wrote this even thinking? Mind you, this does not apply in any way to trans women, bit of a kick in the gut, eh?<br>
        The least we can do is make enough noise before 21 August (when it will take effect). I'm going to talk with a cis woman who teaches chess in my area to see if she agrees to compete against me in chess (I only know the basic moves) to prove that I have no advantage over her.<br>
        So I guess that's that, fuck the FIDE, goodnight.<br><br>
