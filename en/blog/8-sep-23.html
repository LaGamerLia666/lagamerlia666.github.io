      <h3>The <s>&sol;e&sol;cosystem</s> LineageOS experience</h3>
      <p>Yeah, so I forgot to talk about the installation that went down 2 days ago.<br>
      It was okay. I didn't have many problems.<br>
      The <a href="https://doc.e.foundation/devices/Mi439/install" target="_blank">tutorial</a> I followed had a small problem regarding step 1 of "Flashing additional partitions" where the files with the latest date were apparently too new for the latest build for my phone, but I just downloaded older files and I was done.<br>
      Now, while using &sol;e&sol; and being free of Google's shackles is great and all that, I don't like it. I just rely too much on Google services to do what I do so I can't leave it yet.<br>
      So I said "fuck it" and installed LineageOS instead.<br>
      And while I might think this is possibly the best experience I have had with an Android device ever, it still has a small problem: It does not come with Google services, you have to sideload a package through ADB that installs the Google app and Play Store, because apparently it's illegal to have them built-in since LineageOS is open source and Google apps aren't.<br>
      That was this Wednesday and I've had 2 days to test the new phone out and I gotta say, it's a great experience. If I ever change my opinion about it, I'll still have a higher regar for it than MIUI just because that cesspool has very intrusive ads.<br>
      Goodnight.<p>
