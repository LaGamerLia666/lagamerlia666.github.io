      <p>I'm chronically online, I'm a programmer, I'm a student, I'm a minor, that's all you need to know.</p>
      <h3>What is this webbed site?</h3>
      <p>I guess it's a mix of a personal blog and documenting my projects, for now I don't have either prepared.</p>
      <h3>Why did you create this site?</h3>
      <p>I really wanna copy <a href="https://maia.crimew.gay">Maia</a>'s website.</p>
      <h3>Did you make up most of these questions?</h3>
      <p>No, I made all of them up.</p>
      <h3>What are your pronouns?</h3>
      <p><a href="/img/twitter-bio-12-august-2023.png" target="_blank">Are you blind?</a> I use any pronouns but I have a preference towards she/her.</p>
