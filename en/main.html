My biggest project to date is also my first project and also lost media because I'm stupid and don't know how to use version control.<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;I'm a big gamer and a small programmer, my favorite games are the old and decrepit ones from the 90s because my computer can't run anything else (but they're good anyway).<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;I like doing LGBTQ+ activism because I'm very calm and I think it's funny seeing the right calling us snowflakes while they cry at the sight of women who love women.</p>
