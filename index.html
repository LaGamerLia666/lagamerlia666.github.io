      <h1>ATTENTION</h1>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 100%;">THIS SITE IS VERY BROKEN.<br>If your aspect ratio is thinner than 16:9 BEWARE!<br>I'm learning how to make websites so even if the frontend looks sleek and cool it looks like DOGSHIT on the inside! I wont't apologize, it's not my fault for being young and stupid.<br>
      Click anywhere to enter the site.<br>You have been warned.</p>
      <!--<p style="padding-bottom: 100%;">The site is currentçy migrating to GitHub Pages.<br>
      I don't have a site yet but it's probably gonna be silicosis1.github.io if you wanna ask for ransom.<br>
      Click anywhere to go to the old (neocities) site.</p>-->
